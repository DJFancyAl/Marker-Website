                                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">1. General Use</h3>
                                    <p>Use of and access to the Marker Systems website is subject to the following conditions. Marker Systems LLC. does not recognize
                                        any conflicting conditions unless expressly agreed to in writing.</p>
                                    <p>It is generally possible to use the website without the provision of personal data. Where personal data are collected on any
                                        website pages (e.g. name, address or e-mail address) they are always, as far as possible, provided on a voluntary basis.
                                        These data are not passed on to third parties without your express consent.</p>
                                    <p>Marker Systems LLC. wishes to point out that the transmission of data over the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) may be
                                        subject to security breaches. It is not possible to completely secure the data from access by third parties.</p>
                                    <p>Use by third parties of contact data published in the mandatory Legal Notice for sending advertising and information materials
                                        not explicitly requested is herewith expressly prohibited. Marker Systems LLC. expressly reserves the right to take legal steps
                                        if such unsolicited advertising information is sent, such as in the case of spam e-mails.</p>
                                    <p>These terms and conditions apply to all components and content of the online offering of the website of Marker Systems.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">2. Access Data/Server Log Files</h3>
                                    <p>Marker Systems (or its web space provider) collects data on each access to the site (by means of so-called server log files).
                                        The access data include:</p>
                                    <p>Name of website or file accessed, date and time of the access, volume of data transferred, notification of successful
                                        access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, the referrer URL (the page visited previously), IP address
                                        and the requesting provider.</p>
                                    <p>Marker Systems LLC. shall use the log data only for statistical analyses for the purpose of the site’s operation, security and
                                        optimization. Marker Systems LLC, however, reserves the right to review the log data subsequently if there are specific
                                        indications that justify a suspicion of illegal use.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">3. Embedding of Third-Party Services and Content</h3>
                                    <p>Third-party content, such as YouTube videos, material provided by Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites may
                                        be embedded in this website. The prerequisite for this is always that the provider of this content (hereinafter referred to
                                        as “Third-Party Provider”) sees the IP address of the user as these providers would not be able to send the content to the
                                        respective user’s browser without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required so that this content can be provided.
                                        Marker Systems LLC. endeavors to only use content from providers who use the IP address merely to provide the content. However,
                                        we have no control over whether the Third-Party Provider stores the IP address, e.g. for statistical purposes. We shall inform
                                        users thereof to the extent that we are aware of such a practice.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">4. Cookies</h3>
                                    <p>Cookies are small files that make it possible to store specific device-related information on the user’s device (PC, smartphone,
                                        etc). Cookies are used to make websites user-friendly for users (e.g. storing of login data). Cookies are also used to record
                                        the statistical data concerning use of the website and to analyze the data to improve the site. Users can control the use of
                                        cookies. Most browsers have an option allowing cookies to be stored on a limited basis or to be completely blocked. However,
                                        it must be noted that the use, and in particular the ease of use, of the website may be restricted without cookies.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-uppercase">5. Google Analytics</h3>
                                    <p>This website uses Google analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”
                                        (see above). The information regarding the use of this website generated by the cookies is generally transmitted to and stored
                                        on a Google server in the US.</p>
